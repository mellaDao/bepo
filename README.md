# bepo

## Description 
My husband and I were semi-interested in dabbling with game development so we created 'bepo'. 
'bepo' was originally intended to be a rogue-lite, card deck building game but we are not fully decided on the details. 
It is very much a work in progress and something we work on together on and off.

### For Developers:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mellaDao/bepo.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Run the game from the Unity editor by pressing `Play`.
